	The concept of going to a new environment and immediately feeling settled is something one reads or hears about, but may not personally experience. Furthermore, what solutions are offered for this dilemma? Mine was simple, food.
After graduating from college and getting a job in my field, I realized my idea of success wasn’t the one I had feeding into. It was my parents. My job was toxic, and it brought to light just how much I had just been going through the motions of what was expected of me. I knew what my next steps needed to be, but I’m the kind of babe that loves to operate with a plan. Not a stranger to spontaneity, but I do like having some calculations worked out as well. The day I submitted my resignation, one of my best friends told me about a program she wanted to do to teach English in South Korea. It was so far and had no relation to my field, but that also eventually became its allure. I was in.

		My friend and I took a 4-month intensive Korean language course in prep, then we were off! Once we made it to our city, it was clear that the only way to get used to everything quickly, was to go out. But go out and do what? Forage for food. My friend and another foreigner we met through our program decided to go out frequently to find food places and cafés. Before we knew it, we were very familiar with our city and decided to apply that same practice on all our travels. So it was only natural to apply that when we got back to Dallas after 2 years and had reverse culture shock. Everything seemed so different yet familiar. With our love for food and willingness to explore, this blog was born!
